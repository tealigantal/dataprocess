{"input":{"plain":"I want to talk about a small bakery in my neighborhood called Sweet Delights. It's run by a young couple who started it three years ago with just a small oven and few recipes. At first, business was slow because not many people knew about them. But they worked very hard every day, waking up early to bake fresh bread and cakes. Their special item is a chocolate croissant which is very delicious and not too expensive. Slowly, word spread about their tasty products and friendly service. Now they have many regular customers including me. Every morning I see a line of people waiting to buy their breakfast. What makes them successful is they always use good ingredients and listen to customer feedback. Last month they even started making special cakes for birthdays and weddings. Although they are still small, their business is growing steadily. I admire their passion and hope they can open more branches in the future.","pause_count":42,"pause_total":27.3,"errors":["
